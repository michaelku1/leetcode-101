Use ChatGPT as a Powerful Learning Companion for LeetCode

LeetCode is every software engineer’s favorite—or most dreaded—part of interview preparation. To make the process more enjoyable and sustainable, I experimented with turning LeetCode practice into a repeatable, fun routine—drawing inspiration from the addictive nature of social media scrolling (think Instagram).

The concept is simple: use ChatGPT prompts to create a dynamic, running tutorial—similar to what platforms like Educative aim to provide, but tailored to you. The experience becomes visually appealing and cognitively digestible, allowing you to approach LeetCode practice like a daily workout—something quick, effective, and easy to commit to.

This idea is based on a few key insights:

Personalized Learning Works Best
Reading others’ notes hits a ceiling quickly—because their logic might not match your way of thinking, especially when you're just starting out.

Focused Learning Sessions Are Key
A fixed, consistent time window keeps you from burning out or procrastinating.

Digestible, Engaging Content Increases Stickiness
Think of the way you scroll social media without thinking—you want your LeetCode practice to feel just as frictionless and addictive.

Minimal Setup = Daily Consistency
The less overhead there is to get started, the more likely you are to show up every day.

So I experimented with a few prompt formats—and ChatGPT responded with a surprisingly engaging, interactive interface, like this:

Soon I will release a handful of fun prompts to try which are tailored to different learning cases/objectives for your own use. Stay tuned!
